# Pomo-duino: 
---
An Arduino-based pomodo timer that tracks your study habits

# How we built it:
We used an Arduino MEGA board for our main piece of hardware and 4 digit 7 Segment LEDs for displaying our pomodoro timer.

For the software part, we used Python and Javascript for our frontend and backend. We used Flask to create a server and host our website and Sqlite for our database.
